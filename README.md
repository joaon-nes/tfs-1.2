Based on TFS 1.2 version 8.0, I'm adding some of Tibia's most current systems as a challenge in learning the C++ language.

Some systems have already been added, such as:

Familiars
Item classification and tiers, and an imbue system coming soon.
Some new basic attributes, such as life leech, mana leech, and critical. I'm also working on elemental magic levels.
Quivers working perfectly.
I'm working on adding mounts, among other features present in Tibia 15+.
